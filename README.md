# Captcha Reading

## Project Statement
The project aims to develop an advanced model capable of recognizing and interpreting characters in CAPTCHA input. By overcoming the challenge of distinguishing between distorted or obscured characters, which serve as an automated entry prevention mechanism on websites, this model seeks to push the boundaries of current AI capabilities in pattern recognition.

## Motivation for solving this problem
As artificial intelligence progresses, its ability to interpret complex visual data has seen significant advancements. This project is motivated by the potential to leverage these AI advancements for automating the solving of CAPTCHA mechanisms, traditionally designed to deter automated access. Solving CAPTCHAs automatically could significantly benefit various fields, including accessibility for users with disabilities, testing of automated services, and improving AI's understanding of distorted or obscured texts and images.

## Specific Objectives
### Task Description
Input : Distorted character images

Output : Original characters
### Dataset
MNIST database(dataset for single-digit numbers), dataset for single characters, dataset for words, and CAPTCHA dataset will be used.
### Approach
- **Train the model using individual characters to enhance its understanding of characters.**
- **After training the model with individual characters, further train it to enhance its ability to recognize words.**
- **To recognize distorted words, additional training with relevant datasets is necessary.**
## Results expected
Upon successful completion of the project, we anticipate the following outcomes:
- **Development of an artificial intelligence model capable of accurately recognizing characters in CAPTCHA inputs.**
- **Enhanced efficiency in automated CAPTCHA solving, potentially reducing human intervention in accessing websites with CAPTCHA mechanisms.**
